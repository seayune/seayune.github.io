          New York-based, Hong Kong-Canadian pianist and composer Arthur Siyun Li has emerged as
          an active exponent of modern and contemporary music.

          As the winner of the Eisenberg-Fried Concerto Competition at the Manhattan School of
          Music (MSM), he made his concerto debut in October ‘23 with MSM’s OPUS 130
          Orchestra and conductor David Chan performing Alfred Schnittke’s <span class="italic">Concerto for
          Piano and String Orchestra</span>. Other recent performance highlights include a recital
          at the Salle de l’Institut in Orléans, France, as a quarterfinalist of the
          International Piano Competition of Orléans, and selections from John Cage’s <span class="italic">Sonatas
          and Interludes</span> for prepared piano at National Sawdust (<span class="italic">THE RASA PROJECT</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Li’s most recent work for string quartet was commissioned by the French non-profit Entraide
          Française and
          performed at Villa Albertine in New York. His orchestral work, <span class="italic">enshrinement</span>,
          for oboe, harp, piano, and string orchestra, was awarded the Carl Kanter Prize for
          Orchestral Composition at MSM in May ‘24. Li is a recipient of the Tactus Commission Prize.

          Li begins his doctorate (D.M.A.) in Performance Practice at Cornell University this
          fall as a Sage Fellow, in the studio of pianist Xak Bjerken.
          Previously, he completed concurrent master’s degrees in performance and composition
          at MSM, where he was a student of pianist Alexandre Moutouzkine and composer/soprano
          Susan Botti, as well as an undergraduate degree in Music Theory and History at the
          University of Toronto. He has received mentorship from pianists Wha Kyung Byun,
          Dang Thai Son, Anthony de Mare, and Margaret Kampmeier, and from composers Reiko
          Füting, Chen Yi, and Chinary Ung. Li is an official Steinway Teacher and Educational
          Partner (STEP).
