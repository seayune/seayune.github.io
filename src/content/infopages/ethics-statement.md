Since its founding in 2012, **AuthorsWave Media** has adhered to a comprehensive ethics policy to ensure the integrity and independence of our journalism. Our team is committed to maintaining the trust of our audience by adhering to ethical guidelines that often surpass industry standards.

Building and retaining trust with our audience is central to our mission. In an era where information is disseminated across numerous platforms, it is essential to establish transparent ethical practices that enable our readers to evaluate the credibility and origins of the information we share.

## Editorial Independence

Our most valuable asset is the independence that empowers us to report stories without undue influence or bias.

At **AuthorsWave Media**, we take pride in reporting the truth, even when it challenges powerful entities. Our editorial independence is protected by a strict code of conduct followed by every member of our team. Furthermore, we maintain a firm boundary between our editorial and advertising teams.

### Core Principles of Our Code of Conduct:

- We do not accept gifts, monetary compensation, or favors from companies or their representatives.
- We do not agree to preconditions for covering stories that compromise our editorial autonomy.
- We do not allow interview subjects to review or approve questions or stories before publication.
- We do not permit our reporters to cover entities or individuals with whom they have personal conflicts of interest.
- We do not make paid endorsements.
- Our team members do not hold financial interests in the companies we report on.
- Our editorial team does not produce paid content under any circumstances.

Any travel or related expenses for coverage are paid for by **AuthorsWave Media**, including transportation, lodging, and meals.

## Professional Conduct

Our editorial team adheres to established ethical standards in journalism, taking care to seek truth, report accurately, minimize harm, and maintain transparency. We use the [Society of Professional Journalistsâ€™ Code of Ethics](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) as a foundational guide.

## Sourcing Standards

We uphold rigorous sourcing practices to ensure our reporting is accurate and trustworthy. Confidentiality is respected when appropriate, and our policies for sourcing include:

Agreements regarding these terms must be explicitly established between reporters and sources.

## Advertising Policy

Our advertising team operates independently of the editorial team. Sponsored content is clearly labeled as "Sponsored Content" or "Advertiser Content." Advertisements do not influence our editorial decisions or content.

Affiliate links may appear in some content, and **AuthorsWave Media** may earn a commission from purchases made through these links. These partnerships are disclosed transparently, and our editorial team remains uninfluenced by affiliate relationships.

While we strive for accuracy, errors can occur. When mistakes are identified, we promptly issue corrections and transparently note changes to our content. Updates to stories for clarity or new developments are clearly marked to inform readers.

## Reviews and Product Evaluations

Product reviews published by **AuthorsWave Media** reflect the honest opinions of our editorial team. Companies may provide temporary review units for evaluation purposes, but such arrangements do not influence our assessments. Reviews are never paid for or sponsored.

Our team members are prohibited from investing in or trading the stock of companies covered by **AuthorsWave Media**. Employees are also not allowed to hold advisory roles or receive compensation from entities we report on.
