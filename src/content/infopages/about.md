Arthur Siyun Li (b.1998) is a Hong Kong-Canadian pianist and composer based in Brooklyn, New York.

A student of pianist Alexandre Moutouzkine and composer/soprano Susan Botti, Li is the first to receive concurrent graduate degrees from the Manhattan School of Music (MSM), completing a dual M.M. in composition and piano in May ‘24. He has received mentorship from pianists Wha Kyung Byun, Anthony de Mare and Margaret Kampmeier, and from composers Chen Yi and Chinary Ung.

In tandem with his own compositional practice and through collaborations with living composers, Li has emerged as an active performer and exponent of new and contemporary music. As the winner of the Eisenberg-Fried Concerto Competition at MSM, he made his concerto debut in October ‘23 with MSM’s OPUS 130 Orchestra and conductor David Chan performing Alfred Schnittke’s *Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra*. Other recent performance highlights include selections from John Cage’s *Sonatas and Interludes* for prepared piano at National Sawdust, solo and chamber performances of new works at the Tenri Cultural Institute and MSM’s Neidorff-Karpati Hall with the BeComEnsemble, solo and two-piano works of Chin, Kondo, and Lutosławski for Mostly Modern Festival at Zankel Hall, and the Scotia Festival of Music’s Highlight Concerts at Dalhousie Arts Center.

Li’s recent composition, *enshrinement*, for oboe, harp, piano, and string orchestra, was awarded the Carl Kanter Prize for Orchestral Composition at the Manhattan School of Music in May ‘24. As the winner of the Tactus Commission Prize, his work, *like plucked strings /*, for large ensemble, was commissioned and performed by MSM’s resident contemporary ensemble, Tactus, in December ’23.
